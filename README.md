# Heart_Disease_Data_Analysis

🚀 Project Highlight: Heart Disease Data Analysis

I recently completed a Heart Disease Data Analysis project where I explored clinical and demographic data to uncover key factors influencing heart disease.

🔍 Project Overview

Analyzed patient data including age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, ECG results, and exercise-induced indicators.

Focused on identifying patterns associated with the presence of heart disease.

🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

GroupBy analysis & statistical comparisons

📊 Key Insights

Identified age groups and gender trends with higher heart disease risk.

Compared cholesterol levels across genders.

Analyzed heart disease prevalence among patients above 60 years.

Evaluated the most common chest pain types linked to heart disease.

📈 Outcome

This project strengthened my skills in data analysis, healthcare analytics, and insight generation, helping transform raw medical data into meaningful conclusions that can support data-driven healthcare decisions.

💡 Always excited to work on real-world datasets and continue growing as a Data Analyst.
